Like Predicate
</h1>
<h3>
Heavy usage of fuzzy like pattern matching is used along with wild carding the search box queries<br>
for example a sample search term would be "term" and <br>
the pattern will get recorded and query to the db will be constructed like following <br>
<br>
<span style="color:blue;">select * from movies where title like '%term%' order by year_asc limit 0,5;</span> 
<br>
<br>

where like denotes the fuzzy matching and '%term% enables substring matching as well.
